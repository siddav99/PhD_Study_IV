abstract = {Background: Accurate and up-to-date assessment of demographic metrics is crucial for understanding a wide range of social, economic, and public health issues that affect populations worldwide. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 produced updated and comprehensive demographic assessments of the key indicators of fertility, mortality, migration, and population for 204 countries and territories and selected subnational locations from 1950 to 2019. Methods: 8078 country-years of vital registration and sample registration data, 938 surveys, 349 censuses, and 238 other sources were identified and used to estimate age-specific fertility. Spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (ST-GPR) was used to generate age-specific fertility rates for 5-year age groups between ages 15 and 49 years. With extensions to age groups 10-14 and 50-54 years, the total fertility rate (TFR) was then aggregated using the estimated age-specific fertility between ages 10 and 54 years. 7417 sources were used for under-5 mortality estimation and 7355 for adult mortality. ST-GPR was used to synthesise data sources after correction for known biases. Adult mortality was measured as the probability of death between ages 15 and 60 years based on vital registration, sample registration, and sibling histories, and was also estimated using ST-GPR. HIV-free life tables were then estimated using estimates of under-5 and adult mortality rates using a relational model life table system created for GBD, which closely tracks observed age-specific mortality rates from complete vital registration when available. Independent estimates of HIV-specific mortality generated by an epidemiological analysis of HIV prevalence surveys and antenatal clinic serosurveillance and other sources were incorporated into the estimates in countries with large epidemics. Annual and single-year age estimates of net migration and population for each country and territory were generated using a Bayesian hierarchical cohort component model that analysed estimated age-specific fertility and mortality rates along with 1250 censuses and 747 population registry years. We classified location-years into seven categories on the basis of the natural rate of increase in population (calculated by subtracting the crude death rate from the crude birth rate) and the net migration rate. We computed healthy life expectancy (HALE) using years lived with disability (YLDs) per capita, life tables, and standard demographic methods. Uncertainty was propagated throughout the demographic estimation process, including fertility, mortality, and population, with 1000 draw-level estimates produced for each metric. Findings: The global TFR decreased from 2{\textperiodcentered}72 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 2{\textperiodcentered}66-2{\textperiodcentered}79) in 2000 to 2{\textperiodcentered}31 (2{\textperiodcentered}17-2{\textperiodcentered}46) in 2019. Global annual livebirths increased from 134{\textperiodcentered}5 million (131{\textperiodcentered}5-137{\textperiodcentered}8) in 2000 to a peak of 139{\textperiodcentered}6 million (133{\textperiodcentered}0-146{\textperiodcentered}9) in 2016. Global livebirths then declined to 135{\textperiodcentered}3 million (127{\textperiodcentered}2-144{\textperiodcentered}1) in 2019. Of the 204 countries and territories included in this study, in 2019, 102 had a TFR lower than 2{\textperiodcentered}1, which is considered a good approximation of replacement-level fertility. All countries in sub-Saharan Africa had TFRs above replacement level in 2019 and accounted for 27{\textperiodcentered}1% (95% UI 26{\textperiodcentered}4-27{\textperiodcentered}8) of global livebirths. Global life expectancy at birth increased from 67{\textperiodcentered}2 years (95% UI 66{\textperiodcentered}8-67{\textperiodcentered}6) in 2000 to 73{\textperiodcentered}5 years (72{\textperiodcentered}8-74{\textperiodcentered}3) in 2019. The total number of deaths increased from 50{\textperiodcentered}7 million (49{\textperiodcentered}5-51{\textperiodcentered}9) in 2000 to 56{\textperiodcentered}5 million (53{\textperiodcentered}7-59{\textperiodcentered}2) in 2019. Under-5 deaths declined from 9{\textperiodcentered}6 million (9{\textperiodcentered}1-10{\textperiodcentered}3) in 2000 to 5{\textperiodcentered}0 million (4{\textperiodcentered}3-6{\textperiodcentered}0) in 2019. Global population increased by 25{\textperiodcentered}7%, from 6{\textperiodcentered}2 billion (6{\textperiodcentered}0-6{\textperiodcentered}3) in 2000 to 7{\textperiodcentered}7 billion (7{\textperiodcentered}5-8{\textperiodcentered}0) in 2019. In 2019, 34 countries had negative natural rates of increase; in 17 of these, the population declined because immigration was not sufficient to counteract the negative rate of decline. Globally, HALE increased from 58{\textperiodcentered}6 years (56{\textperiodcentered}1-60{\textperiodcentered}8) in 2000 to 63{\textperiodcentered}5 years (60{\textperiodcentered}8-66{\textperiodcentered}1) in 2019. HALE increased in 202 of 204 countries and territories between 2000 and 2019. Interpretation: Over the past 20 years, fertility rates have been dropping steadily and life expectancy has been increasing, with few exceptions. Much of this change follows historical patterns linking social and economic determinants, such as those captured by the GBD Socio-demographic Index, with demographic outcomes. More recently, several countries have experienced a combination of low fertility and stagnating improvement in mortality rates, pushing more populations into the late stages of the demographic transition. Tracking demographic change and the emergence of new patterns will be essential for global health monitoring. Funding: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.},

abstract = {Background: The epidemiological transition of non-communicable diseases replacing infectious diseases as the main contributors to disease burden has been well documented in global health literature. Less focus, however, has been given to the relationship between sociodemographic changes and injury. The aim of this study was to examine the association between disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from injury for 195 countries and territories at different levels along the development spectrum between 1990 and 2017 based on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 estimates. Methods: Injury mortality was estimated using the GBD mortality database, corrections for garbage coding and CODEm-the cause of death ensemble modelling tool. Morbidity estimation was based on surveys and inpatient and outpatient data sets for 30 cause-of-injury with 47 nature-of-injury categories each. The Socio-demographic Index (SDI) is a composite indicator that includes lagged income per capita, average educational attainment over age 15 years and total fertility rate. Results: For many causes of injury, age-standardised DALY rates declined with increasing SDI, although road injury, interpersonal violence and self-harm did not follow this pattern. Particularly for self-harm opposing patterns were observed in regions with similar SDI levels. For road injuries, this effect was less pronounced. Conclusions: The overall global pattern is that of declining injury burden with increasing SDI. However, not all injuries follow this pattern, which suggests multiple underlying mechanisms influencing injury DALYs. There is a need for a detailed understanding of these patterns to help to inform national and global efforts to address injury-related health outcomes across the development spectrum.},

@article{Kruithof2017,
abstract = {Background Over the past decades, the number of survivors of injuries has rapidly grown. It has become important to focus more on the determinants of non-fatal outcome. Although socio-economic status (SES) is considered to be a fundamental determinant of health in general, the role of SES as a determinant of non-fatal outcome after injury is largely unknown. Methods An online search was conducted in November 2015 using Embase, Medline, Web of Science, Cinahl, Cochrane, Google scholar and PubMed. Studies examining the relation between SES and a physical or psychological outcome measure, or using SES as a confounder in a general trauma population were included. There were no restrictions regarding study design. The 'Quality in Prognostic Studies tool' was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Results The 24 included studies showed large variations in methodological quality. The number of participants ranged from 56 to 4639, and assessments of the measures ranged from immediately to 6 year post-injury. Studies used a large number of variables as indicators of SES. Participant's educational level was used most frequently. The majority of the studies used a multivariable technique to analyse the relation between SES and non-fatal outcome after injury. All studies found a positive association (80% of studies significant, n = 19) between increased SES and better non-fatal outcome after injury. Conclusion Although an adequate and valid measure of SES is lacking, the results of this review showed that SES is an important determinant of non-fatal outcome after injury. Future research should focus on the definition and measurement of SES and should further underpin the effect of SES on non-fatal outcome after injury.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine) recently recommended inclusion of postdischarge health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) metrics to benchmark the quality of trauma care. Currently, these measures are not routinely collected at most trauma centers. We sought to determine the feasibility and value of adding such long-term outcome measures to trauma registries. METHODS: As part of the FORTE (Functional Outcomes and Recovery after Trauma Emergencies) project, we included patients with an Injury Severity Score of 9 or greater, admitted to the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, MA, who were identified retrospectively using the institutional trauma registry and contacted 6 or 12 months after injury to participate in a telephone survey evaluating HRQoL (Short Form 12 [SF-12]), PROs (Trauma Quality of Life), posttraumatic stress disorder, return to work, residential status, and health care utilization. RESULTS: Data were collected for 171 of 394 eligible patients: 85/189 (45%) at 6 months and 86/205 (42%) at 12 months; 25%/29% (6/12 months) patients could not be contacted, 15%/16% (6/12 months) declined to participate, and 15%/13% (6/12 months) were interested in participating at another time but were not reached again. Approximately 20% patients screened positive for posttraumatic stress disorder, and half had not yet returned to work. There were significant reductions in SF-12 physical composite scores relative to population norms (mean, 50 [SD, 10]) at 6 months (mean, 44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 41-47) and 12 months (45; 95% CI, 42-47); no difference was noted in the SF-12 mental composite scores (6 months: 51 [95% CI, 48-54]; 12 months: 50 [95% CI, 46-53]). CONCLUSIONS: Trauma patients reported considerable impairment 6 and 12 months after injury. Routine collection of PROs and HRQoL provides important data regarding trauma outcomes beyond mortality and will enable the development of quality improvement metrics that better reflect patients' postinjury experiences. Improved and alternate methods for collection of these data need to be developed to enhance response rates before widespread adoption across trauma centers in the United States. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic/epidemiologic, level II; Therapeutic, level III.},

abstract = {Study design: Cross-sectional study. Objectives: To determine the degree of impoverishment of people with spinal cord injury (SCI) and their families in Bangladesh caused by loss of work-related income following injury. Setting: Spinal cord injury centre, Bangladesh. Methods: A total of 410 wheelchair-dependent people with recent SCI about to be discharged from a hospital in Bangladesh were interviewed to determine the size of their families, their incomes from paid work prior to injury and the incomes of their family members. These data were used to calculate income per family unit and per family member prior to and immediately after injury. Results: Ninety percent of the participants were men, 98% were from rural areas of Bangladesh and 58% were manual labours prior to injury. Median (interquartile range, IQR) family size was 5 (4-6) people. Prior to injury, 74% of participants were the main income earners for their families and 50% provided the only source of income for their families. Participants' median (IQR) monthly income prior to injury was US$106 (US$60-US$180) per person and family members' income was US$30 (US$19-US$48) per person. After injury, the median income (IQR) of each family member dropped to US$0 (US$0-US$18) placing 91% of families below the extreme poverty line of US$37.50 per person per month (equivalent to US$1.25 per day). Conclusion: In Bangladesh, SCI have profound financial implications for individuals and their families and causes extreme poverty. This is because those most often injured are young and the main income earners for their families.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Injuries are among the 10 leading causes of deaths worldwide. In recent years, the quality and reporting of injury mortality has improved but little or no data are available on the morbidity burden and impact of non-fatal injuries in India. This study evaluates health recovery status postinjury, identifying predictors of recovery in North India. METHODS: Prospective cohort study recruiting patients from one tertiary-level and two secondary-level hospitals in North India between April and June 2014 hospitalised due to any injury. Health-related quality of life was assessed at baseline and at 1-month, 2-month, 4-month and 12-month postinjury using the EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire. Multivariable linear regressions with generalised estimating equations were used to examine the relationship between sociodemographic and injury-related factors with the EQ-5D-5L single utility score and the visual analogue scale (VAS) score. RESULTS: A total of 2416 eligible patients aged >=18 years were enrolled in the study. Of these, 2150 (74%) completed baseline and all four follow-up EQ-5D-5L questionnaires. Almost 7% (n=172) patients died by the first follow-up and the overall mortality at 12 months was 9% (n=176). Both EQ-5D-5L utility and VAS scores dropped significantly at 1-month postinjury but gradually improved at 2, 4 and 12 months. Severe injuries, defined as those requiring a hospital stay of >=7 days, were associated with lower utility scores at 1-month, 2-month and 4-month follow-ups (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: This is the first study to examine health outcomes following injuries in India. The findings highlight the need to understand the social, psychological and biological factors influencing recovery outcomes. High mortality following discharge emphasises the need to invest in secondary and tertiary injury prevention in India.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Injuries create major financial burden for families. In this study, we estimated the distribution of out-of-pocket payment for medical care of injuries and the role of health insurance in containing such costs.\n\nMETHODS: A prospective cohort study of 892 injured patients admitted to a provincial general hospital between Jan 1, 2010, and Aug 31, 2010, in Vietnam was done. Data for demographic, injury characteristics, and costs by specific categories paid out-of-pocket by patients were included in the analyses. Generalised linear models with log link and gamma distribution were used to examine the associations between insurance status and total medical care costs and specific cost component.\n\nFINDINGS: The average total medical care costs paid out-of-pocket by patients during hospital stays were greater than US$270 (SD 193). Major drivers of total medical care costs related to surgery (nearly 25%), diagnostic tests or examinations (24%), and drugs (23%). Burn injuries incurred the highest medical care costs during hospital stays (mean US$321 [SD 179]) and assault incurred the lowest costs (mean US$167 [SD 165]). Total costs were higher for more severe injuries and those that required a higher level of surgery (from US$122 for maximum abbreviated injury score [MAIS] of 1 to US$485 to MAIS of 5; and US$194 for non-surgery, US$202 for minor surgery, and US$428 for major surgery). Patients using health insurance had lower total costs than those who did not (US$245 vs US$279). However, no significant associations were noted between health insurance and total costs (p=0{\textperiodcentered}142), costs for surgery (p=0{\textperiodcentered}154), diagnostic tests or examinations (p=0{\textperiodcentered}689), or drugs (p=0{\textperiodcentered}341).\n\nINTERPRETATION: This study provides estimates and distribution of costs of medical care for injuries in hospital. Patients and their families seemed to bear all or most of these costs. Although the study highlights the need for ongoing efforts in injury prevention, it also provides further evidence on the few benefits of health insurance in protecting patients and their families from the high costs of hospital stays in Vietnam.\n\nFUNDING: Atlantic Philanthropies.},

Health-related quality of life 24 months after sustaining a minor musculoskeletal injury in a road traffic crash: A prospective cohort study

@article{Gopinath2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Taylor  &  Francis Group, LLC. Objectives: A better understanding of the long-term factors that independently predict poorer quality of life following mild to moderate musculoskeletal injuries is needed. We aimed to establish the predictors of quality of life (including sociodemographic, health, psychosocial, and pre-injury factors) 24 months after a noncatastrophic road traffic injury. Methods: In a prospective cohort study of 252 participants with mild/moderate injury sustained in a road traffic crash, quality of life was measured 24 months following the baseline survey. A telephone-administered questionnaire obtained information on various potential explanatory variables. Health-related quality of life was measured using the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-12 (SF-12). Multivariable linear regression analyses determined the associations between explanatory variables and quality of life measures. Results: Mean SF-12 physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores increased by 7.3 and 2.5 units, respectively, from baseline to 24-month follow-up. Each 10-year increase in baseline age was independently associated with 3.1-unit (P  < .001) and 1.5-unit (P =.001) decrease in EQ Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and SF-12 PCS scores at follow-up, respectively. Poor/fair compared to excellent pre-injury health was associated with a 0.16-, 21.3-, and 11.5-unit decrease in EQ-5D summary (P =.03), VAS scores (P =.001), and SF-12 PCS scores (P  < .001), respectively. Baseline pain severity ratings and pain catastrophizing scores were inversely associated with 24-month EQ VAS scores (both P  < .001). Each unit increase in baseline pain score (P =.001) and pain catastrophizing score (P =.02) was associated with a 1.0- and 4.6-unit decrease in SF-12 MCS scores at 24 months, respectively. Other observed predictors of quality of life measures (EQ-5D summary and/or VAS scores and/ or SF-12 MCS) included marital status, smoking, hospital admission, pre-injury health (anxiety/depression and chronic illness), and whiplash injury. Conclusion: Sociodemographic indicators, pre-injury health, and biopsychosocial correlates were independently associated with health-related quality of life 24 months following a noncatastrophic road traffic crash injury.},

@article{Kohler2017,
abstract = {PURPOSE: Low- and middle-income countries face a disproportionate burden of death and disability from injuries, many of which are due to road traffic accidents or falls. Lower extremity injuries in particular have implications not only for physical disabilities affecting work and school performance, but also for quality of life (QOL) of the individual. This qualitative study explores the psychosocial impact and QOL changes due to lower extremity injuries among trauma patients in central Malawi. METHODS: We transcribed and translated interviews with 20 patients who received care for a trauma to the lower extremity at a tertiary hospital in Lilongwe. We used NVivo to organize and thematically analyze the data. RESULTS: Participants reported limitations in physical functioning, activities of daily living, social roles, and vocational and social activities. Limited mobility led to unplanned long-term disruptions in work, personal financial loss, and household economic hardship. As a result, psychological distress, fears and worries about recovery, and poor perceptions of health and QOL were common. Several contextual factors influenced patient outcomes including socioeconomic status, religious beliefs, social networks, local landscape, housing structures, and transportation accessibility. CONCLUSION: Lower extremity trauma led to physical suffering and ongoing social and economic costs among Malawians. Injuries affecting mobility have broad QOL and economic consequences for patients and affected family members. Interventions are needed to improve post-injury recovery and QOL. Better access to trauma surgery and social and welfare support services for people living with disabling conditions are needed to alleviate the consequences of injuries.},

abstract = {Despite recognizing that women have worse outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI), little is known about how gender influences their experiences of this critical injury. Past research has been dominated by androcentrism and quantitative approaches, leaving the lived experience of women with TBI insufficiently examined. To gain insight into their experiences, this qualitative study interviewed 19 Canadian women with mild and moderate-to-severe TBIs. Applying a thematic analysis, we discerned three themes: Gender prevails considers choosing to do gender over complying with physician advice; Consequences of TBI impeding performativity explores how women frame themselves as terrible people for being unable to do gender post-TBI; and Perceptions of receiving care looks at gendered caregiving expectations. These results broadly align with research on how doing gender influences recovery and health outcomes. We discuss the implications of our findings for knowledge translation, future research on women's TBI recovery, and clinical practice.},

abstract = {Background: The success of an injury intervention program can be measured by the proportion of successful return to work (RTW). This study examined factors of successful return to employment among workers suffering from work-related injuries. Methods: Data were obtained from the Social Security Organization, Malaysia database consisting of 10,049 RTW program participants in 2010-2014. The dependent variable was the RTW outcome which consisted of RTW with same employer, RTW with new employer or unsuccessful return. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to test the likelihood of successful return with same employer and new employer against unsuccessful return. Results: Overall, 65.3% of injured workers were successfully returned to employment, 52.8% to the same employer and 12.5% to new employer. Employer interest; motivation; age 30-49 years; intervention less than 9 months; occupational disease; injuries in the lower limbs, upper limbs, and general injuries; and working in the manufacturing, services, and electrical/electronics were associated with returning to work with the same employer against unsuccessful return. Male, employer interest, motivation, age 49 years or younger, intervention less than 6 months, occupational disease, injuries in the upper limbs and services sector of employment were associated with returning to new employer against unsuccessful return. Conclusion: There is a need to strengthen employer commitment for early and intensified intervention that will lead to improvement in the RTW outcome.},

@article{Agrawal2014,
abstract = {In the process of health transition, India is facing rapid pace of demographic aging. Rapid increase in older adult population posed serious concerns regarding health and health care utilization for them. However, very limited research documented resultant implications of demographic aging for health and health care use in the nexus of marital status and gender. With this perspective, the present study examined patterns in morbidity prevalence and health seeking behaviour among older widows in India. Multivariate logistic regression models were estimated to examine the effects of socio-demographic conditions on morbidity prevalence among older widows and their health care seeking behavior. Data from the latest 60th round of National Sample Survey (NSS), 2004 was used. Overall, morbidity prevalence was 13% greater among older widows compared to older widowers. Adjusted prevalence of communicable and non-communicable diseases was found 74 and 192 per 1000 older widows respectively. At the same time, likelihood of seeking health care services for reported morbidities was substantially lower among older widows. The findings of this study are important to support policy makers and health care providers in identifying individuals 'at risk' and could be integrated into the current programs of social, economic and health security for the older persons. {\textcopyright} 2014 Agrawal, Keshri.},

abstract = {<b>Purpose:</b> On April 24, 2013 a building called "Rana Plaza" that housed several garment factories collapsed in Bangladesh. Around 1134 people died and more than 2500 sustained serious injuries. This study evaluates the change in income and occupation of the Rana Plaza survivors as well as their level of community participation and quality of life two years after the incident. It also aimed to gain insight into these survivors' success or failure in economic reintegration. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional survey collected data from the injured garment workers using convenience sampling method. The Short Form 36 Items Questionnaire measured their quality of life, and the Participation Scale measured their community participation restriction level. Poor economic reintegration was defined when a survivor was not working or had an income less than 3000 Taka [US$36]/month. <b>Results:</b> Data were collected from 338 Rana Plaza survivors all of who were previously garment workers. Their income decreased substantially after the disaster. The majority were now engaged in earning livelihood from retail shop management and animal husbandry. A total of 124 survivors (36.6%) were found to be poorly economically reintegrated; females were found to be at greater odds (twice) of poor economic reintegration than males. Those with severe participation restriction scores had four times greater odds and who reported moderate restriction had two times greater odds of poor economic reintegration compared to those with no restriction. <b>Conclusions:</b> Survivors of Rana Plaza factory disaster were facing many health and economic challenges two years after the event. Implications for rehabilitation Rehabilitation service providers should document and describe the health status correctly to understand the burden and monitor the effectiveness of their intervention. Government needs to develop and strengthen rehabilitation capacity as more workers will be injured as the country rapidly industrializes. Factory owners should create light duty work opportunities and provide other workplace modification for injured workers to re-enter the workforce.},

abstract = {Background: Social support is among the most well-established predictors of post-burn psychopathology after burn. Despite a disproportionately large burden of burns in the developing world, the nature of social support among burn patients in this context remains elusive. We, therefore, seek to investigate social support and its biopsychosocial determinants among patients with burn injuries in Pakistan. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 343 patients presenting with burn injuries at four teaching hospitals in the Punjab province of Pakistan was conducted. Patient evaluation consisted of a multi-part survey of demographic status, clinical features, and social support as measured by the validated Urdu translation of the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). Multiple regression analysis was performed to evaluate associations between patient characteristics and MSPSS score. Results: Mean overall MSPSS score was 57.64 (std dev 13.57). Notable positive predictors of social support include male gender, Punjabi ethnicity, burn surface area, and ego resiliency. Conclusion: Our study reveals a troubling pattern of inadequate social support among certain subgroups of Pakistani burn patients. Addressing these inequities in the provision of social support must be prioritized as part of the global burn care agenda. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.},

However, many questions surrounding TBI remain unanswered, including questions on sex and gender trends with respect to vulnerability to injury, presentation of injury, response to treatment, and outcomes. Here, we review recent research efforts aimed at advancing knowledge on the constructs of sex and gender and their respective influences in the context of TBI, and discuss methodological challenges in disentangling the differential impacts of these two constructs, particularly in marginalized populations.},

@article{Rissanen2020,
abstract = {PURPOSE: The impact of road traffic crashes on health is well developed, in terms of deaths and direct consequences, but it is less so in terms of long-term life consequences. Few studies have compared the general impact on Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) following road traffic injury (RTI) by using a variety of different injured body parts and severity levels of the injury and compared them with a sample of non-injured referent individuals. Consequently, the aim of the current study is to assess how injury severity is associated with HRQoL, and if it differs between men, women, over age and injured body parts. METHODS: This cross-sectional study identified people with a RTI in the Swedish Traffic Accident Data Acquisition System (STRADA). A frequency matched reference group was also included. Data include both register data and self-reported HRQoL data. RESULTS: A total of 1788 out of 4761 persons with an RTI (37.6%) and 2186 out of 4761 reference persons (45.9%) returned the questionnaire, giving a total response rate of 41.9% (n = 3974). The findings show different patterns of HRQoL loss, depending on sex, age, injured body part, and levels of injury severity. CONCLUSION: The results show that even relatively minor road traffic injuries can lead to a significantly lower of HRQoL, especially for women, compared to the non-injured reference group. Moreover, when the inherent reduction of HRQoL over age was considered, the results indicated that younger individuals have a larger difference from the reference group in HRQoL, independent of the injury severity, compared to the older individuals; hence, an improved understanding of age and gender differences in HRQoL following an RTI is needed to better understand the long-term consequences of injuries from a public health perspective.},

@article{Menon2019,
abstract = {Background: Many countries, including India, seek locally constructed disease burden estimates comprising mortality and loss of health to aid priority setting for the prevention and treatment of diseases. We created the National Burden Estimates (NBE) to provide transparent and understandable disease burdens at the national and subnational levels, and to identify gaps in knowledge. Methods: To calculate the NBE for India, we combined 2017 UN death totals with national and subnational mortality rates for 2010-17 and causes of death from 211 166 verbal autopsy interviews in the Indian Million Death Study for 2010-14. We calculated years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 2017 using published YLD-YLL ratios from WHO Global Health Estimates. We grouped causes of death into 45 groups, including ill-defined deaths, and summed YLLs and YLDs to calculate disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for these causes in eight age groups covering rural and urban areas and 21 major states of India. Findings: In 2017, there were about 9{\textperiodcentered}7 million deaths and 486 million DALYs in India. About three quarters of deaths and DALYs occurred in rural areas. More than a third of national DALYs arose from communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional disorders. DALY rates in rural areas were at least twice those of urban areas for perinatal and nutritional conditions, chronic respiratory diseases, diarrhoea, and fever of unknown origin. DALY rates for ischaemic heart disease were greater in urban areas. Injuries caused 11{\textperiodcentered}4% of DALYs nationally. The top 15 conditions that accounted for the most DALYs were mostly those causing mortality (ischaemic heart disease, perinatal conditions, chronic respiratory diseases, diarrhoea, respiratory infections, cancer, stroke, road traffic accidents, tuberculosis, and liver and alcohol-related conditions), with disability mostly due to a few conditions (nutritional deficiencies, neuropsychiatric conditions, vision and other sensory loss, musculoskeletal disorders, and genitourinary diseases). Every condition that was common in one part of India was uncommon elsewhere, suggesting state-specific priorities for disease control. Interpretation: The NBE method quantifies disease burden using transparent, intuitive, and reproducible methods. It provides a simple, locally operable tool to aid policy makers in priority setting in India and other low-income and middle-income countries. The NBE underlines the need for many more countries to collect nationally representative cause of death data, paired with focused surveys of disability.

@article{Meara2015,
abstract = {Remarkable gains have been made in global health in the past 25 years, but progress has not been uniform. Mortality and morbidity from common conditions needing surgery have grown in the world's poorest regions, both in real terms and relative to other health gains. At the same time, development of safe, essential, life-saving surgical and anaesthesia care in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) has stagnated or regressed. In the absence of surgical care, case-fatality rates are high for common, easily treatable conditions including appendicitis, hernia, fractures, obstructed labour, congenital anomalies, and breast and cervical cancer. In 2015, many LMICs are facing a multifaceted burden of infectious disease, maternal disease, neonatal disease, non-communicable diseases, and injuries. Surgical and anaesthesia care are essential for the treatment of many of these conditions and represent an integral component of a functional, responsive, and resilient health system. In view of the large projected increase in the incidence of cancer, road traffi c injuries, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in LMICs, the need for surgical services in these regions will continue to rise substantially from now until 2030. Reduction of death and disability hinges on access to surgical and anaesthesia care, which should be available, aff ordable, timely, and safe to ensure good coverage, uptake, and outcomes. Despite growing need, the development and delivery of surgical and anaesthesia care in LMICs has been nearly absent from the global health discourse. Little has been written about the human and economic eff ect of surgical conditions, the state of surgical care, or the potential strategies for scale-up of surgical services in LMICs. To begin to address these crucial gaps in knowledge, policy, and action, the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery was launched in January, 2014. The Commission brought together an international, multidisciplinary team of 25 commissioners, supported by advisors and collaborators in more than 110 countries and six continents. We formed four working groups that focused on the domains of health-care delivery and management; workforce, training, and education; economics and fi nance; and information management. Our Commission has fi ve key messages, a set of indicators and recommendations to improve access to safe, aff ordablesurgical and anaesthesia care in LMICs, and a template for a national surgical plan. Our fi ve key messages are presented as follows: 5 billion people do not have access to safe, aff ordable surgical and anaesthesia care when needed. Access is worst in low-income and lower-middle-income countries, where nine of ten people cannot access basic surgical care. 143 million additional surgical procedures are needed in LMICs each year to save lives and prevent disability. Of the 313 million procedures undertaken worldwide each year, only 6% occur in the poorest countries, where over a third of the world's population lives. Low operative volumes are associated with high case-fatality rates from common, treatable surgical conditions. Unmet need is greatest in eastern, western, and central sub-Saharan Africa, and south Asia. 33 million individuals face catastrophic health expenditure due to payment for surgery and anaesthesia care each year. An additional 48 million cases of catastrophic expenditure are attributable to the nonmedical costs of accessing surgical care. A quarter of people who have a surgical procedure will incur fi nancial catastrophe as a result of seeking care. The burden of catastrophic expenditure for surgery is highest in low-income and lower-middle-income countries and, within any country, lands most heavily on poor people. Investing in surgical services in LMICs is aff ordable, saves lives, and promotes economic growth. To meet present and projected population demands, urgent investment in human and physical resources for surgical and anaesthesia care is needed. If LMICs were to scale-up surgical services at rates achieved by the present best-performing LMICs, two-thirds of countries would be able to reach a minimum operative volume of 5000 surgical procedures per 100 000 population by 2030. Without urgent and accelerated investment in surgical scale-up, LMICs will continue to have losses in economic productivity, estimated cumulatively at US $12.3 trillion (2010 US$, purchasing power parity) between 2015 and 2030. Surgery is an "indivisible, indispensable part of health care."1 Surgical and anaesthesia care should be an integral component of a national health system in countries at all levels of development. Surgical services are a prerequisite for the full attainment of local andglobal health goals in areas as diverse as cancer, injury, cardiovascular disease, infection, and reproductive, maternal, neonatal, and child health. Universal health coverage and the health aspirations set out in the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals will be impossible to achieve without ensuring that surgical and anaesthesia care is available, accessible, safe, timely, and aff ordable. In summary, the Commission's key fi ndings show that the human and economic consequences of untreated surgical conditions in LMICs are large and for many years have gone unrecognised. During the past two decades, global health has focused on individual diseases. The development of integrated health services and health systems has been somewhat neglected. As such, surgical care has been aff orded low priority in the world's poorest regions. Our report presents a clear challenge to this approach. As a new era of global health begins in 2015, the focus should be on the development of broad-based health-systems solutions, and resources should be allocated accordingly. Surgical care has an incontrovertible, cross-cutting role in achievement of local and global health challenges. It is an important part of the solution to many diseases-for both old threats and new challenges-and a crucial component of a functional, responsive, and resilient health system. The health gains from scaling up surgical care in LMICs are great and the economic benefi ts substantial. They accrue across all disease-cause categories and at all stages of life, but especially benefi t our youth and young adult populations. The provision of safe and aff ordable surgical and anaesthesia care when needed not only reduces premature death and disability, but also boosts welfare, economic productivity, capacity, and freedoms, contributing to longterm development. Our six core surgical indicators(table 1) should be tracked and reported by all countries and global health organisations, such as the World Bank through the World Development Indicators, WHO through the Global Reference List of 100 Core Health Indicators, and entities tracking the SDGs. At the opening meeting of the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery in January, 2014, Jim Kim, President of the World Bank, stated that: "surgery is an indivisible, indispensable part of health care" and "can help millions of people lead healthier, more productive lives. In 2015, good reason exists to ensure that access to surgical and anaesthesia care is realised for all.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is important to obtain greater insight into health-related quality of life (HRQL) of injury patients in order to document people&#039;s pathways to recovery and to quantify the impact of injury on population health over time. We performed a systematic review of studies measuring HRQL in general injury populations with a generic health state measure to summarize existing knowledge. METHODS: Injury studies (1995-2009) were identified with main inclusion criteria being the use of a generic health status measure and not being restricted to one specific type of injury. Articles were collated by study design, HRQL instrument used, timing of assessment(s), predictive variables and ability to detect change over time. RESULTS: Forty one studies met inclusion criteria, using 24 different generic HRQL and functional status measures (most used were SF-36, FIM, GOS, EQ-5D). The majority of the studies used a longitudinal design, but with different lengths and timings of follow-up (mostly 6, 12, and 24 months). Different generic health measures were able to discriminate between the health status of subgroups and picked up changes in health status between discharge and 12 month follow-up. Most studies reported high prevalences of health problems within the first year after injury. The twelve studies that reported HRQL utility scores showed considerable but incomplete recovery in the first year after discharge. CONCLUSION: This systematic review demonstrates large variation in use of HRQL instruments, study populations, and assessment time points used in studies measuring HRQL of general injury populations. This variability impedes comparison of HRQL summary scores between studies and prevented formal meta-analyses aiming to quantify and improve precision of the impact of injury on population health over time.},

@article{Courvoisier2011,
abstract = {Objective: Logistic regression is commonly used in health research, and it is important to be sure that the parameter estimates can be trusted. A common problem occurs when the outcome has few events; in such a case, parameter estimates may be biased or unreliable. This study examined the relation between correctness of estimation and several data characteristics: number of events per variable (EPV), number of predictors, percentage of predictors that are highly correlated, percentage of predictors that were non-null, size of regression coefficients, and size of correlations. Study Design: Simulation studies. Results: In many situations, logistic regression modeling may pose substantial problems even if the number of EPV exceeds 10. Moreover, the number of EPV is not the only element that impacts on the correctness of parameter estimation. High regression coefficients and high correlations between the predictors may cause large problems in the estimation process. Finally, power is generally very low, even at 20 EPV. Conclusion: There is no single rule based on EPV that would guarantee an accurate estimation of logistic regression parameters. Instead, the number of predictors, probable size of the regression coefficients based on previous literature, and correlations among the predictors must be taken into account as guidelines to determine the necessary sample size. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.
